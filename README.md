# My NixOS flake and modules
self explanatory

## Warning:
this repo does NOT contain a `hardware-configuration.nix` and relies on the config generated by `nixos-generate-config`. This is a deliberate choice due to how many times I reinstall. If you choose to replicate this setup remember to change paths as necessary.
